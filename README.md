# About Me
You can find general info about me here. ðŸ’–

## Intro ðŸ˜„
Hi, my name is Jan and I am currently developing fun stuff such as Discord bots or small Windows software in my freetime. 
I'm currently 17 years old and recently finished my first school graduation. Now I'll continue with college though to attain a better level of education. (grade 11-13).

## What I want to do ðŸ’¼
My favorite thing I want to do in the next few years is to do an exchange year and to go to the USA or to Canada, so I can learn speaking English absolutely fluently. After that I want to finish higher education and study computer science in the networking/IT area. My current dream is to work at Discord or ProtonSystems later. :p
